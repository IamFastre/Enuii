# Enuii
A play on `ennui`, but dissimilarly pronounced `/in-wee/`.

It's a high-level programming language and a successor to the in complete [SEx](https://github.com/IamFastre/SEx) project (it's actually private), and uhh, let's not talk about the naming convention, it's an acronym...
<br/>
But now we start fresh, with a better name and hopefully cleaner, more performant code.
